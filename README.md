Walmart Dummy Spider Documentation

The "Walmart Dummy Spider" is a Python Scrapy spider designed to scrape product price information from the Walmart website using Playwright for browser automation and a proxy service to bypass scraping restrictions. This documentation provides an overview of the spider's code structure, functionality, and how to use it.
Getting Started

To use the "Walmart Dummy Spider," follow these steps:

    Sign up for a proxy service that provides API access for web scraping. You will need an API key for authentication.

    Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

    Install the required Python packages using pip:


pip install scrapy scrapy-playwright urllib3

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the Scrapy spider script (walmart_dummy_spider.py) in a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

Replace 'Your_API_KEY' with your actual proxy service API key in the API_KEY variable:


API_KEY = 'Your_API_KEY'

Modify the url variable in the start_requests function to specify the Walmart product page you want to scrape.

Run the spider using the following command:


    scrapy crawl walmart_Dummy_Spider

    The spider will start scraping product price information from the specified Walmart product page.

Code Structure

The "Walmart Dummy Spider" (walmart_dummy_spider.py) consists of the following components:

    Proxy Configuration
        The spider uses a proxy service provided by "proxy.scrapeops.io" to access the Walmart website. The get_proxy_url function generates the proxy URL with your API key and the target URL.


def get_proxy_url(url):
    payload = {'api_key': API_KEY, 'url': url}
    proxy_url = 'https://proxy.scrapeops.io/v1/?' + urlencode(payload)
    return proxy_url

Scrapy Spider

    The Scrapy spider is named "walmart_Dummy_Spider".

    It starts by specifying the target URL (Walmart product page) and uses the get_proxy_url function to generate the proxy URL.

    Playwright is integrated to automate web interactions, and the playwright_page_methods parameter is used to call the wait_for_selector Playwright method to ensure that the page is fully loaded before scraping.


    def start_requests(self):
        url = "https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/womens-boots/5438_1045804_1045806_3142010_1228542?povid=FashionTopNav_Women_Shoes_Boots"
        yield scrapy.Request(url=get_proxy_url(url), meta=dict(
                playwright=True,
                playwright_include_page=True,
                playwright_page_methods=[PageMethod('wait_for_selector', 'div.flex-wrap')]
            ), callback=self.parse)

        The parse function extracts product price information from the Walmart product page using CSS selectors.

Usage

    Set up your proxy service account and obtain an API key.

    Configure the spider by updating the API_KEY variable with your API key and specifying the Walmart product page URL you want to scrape.

    Run the spider using the command scrapy crawl walmart_Dummy_Spider.

    The spider will navigate to the Walmart product page, extract product price information, and print it to the console.

    You can modify the spider to scrape additional product details or visit different Walmart product pages.

Conclusion

The "Walmart Spider" is a Python Scrapy spider that leverages the Playwright library and a proxy service to scrape product price information from the Walmart website. By following the steps in this documentation, you can set up and run the spider to automate web scraping tasks for e-commerce or data collection purposes.
